st - simple terminal
--------------------
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.

This build has a number of patches applied:
- blinking cursor
- newterm
- workingdir
- vertcenter
- boxdraw
- anysize
- anygeometry
- alpha
- osc 10 11 12
- selectioncolors
- selectionbg alpha
- xresources
- xclearwin
- spoiler

I may have forgotten to list a couple but that should be the majority of them.

It is meant to be used with a tool like tmux or GNU Screen; there will
be little to no keybindings for the terminal itself.

In addition to these patches, I have made a few modifications of my own:
- st now understands urxvt-style OSC 11 sequences, which set the alpha value
- the alpha value can now be kept when OSC 11 is read; this can be turned off
  to allow the terminal to be made fully opaque when using urxvt-style sequences
- implemented OSC 13, 14, 17
- minor changes to the default config to make all the patches play nice together

Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running st
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.
